# Sign Up with LinkedIn on Rails
## Intro

A few months ago I was working on a platform focused on following up and guiding innovation ventures, our client wanted to add an easy way for their users to sign up, and, considering it was focused on professionals, they decided LinkedIn was the best option.

After a lot of tutorials that broke in the middle of the process, stackoverflowing (I guess this works if Googling is a word now) weird bugs, and 16 cups of coffee I decided to write this tutorial with the hope to make someone's work easier.

I will be using the ruby gem [OmniAuth LinkedIn OAuth2](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdecioferreira%2Fomniauth-linkedin-oauth2) in a Ruby on Rails application with [Devise](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise) authentication.

*Note: My actual setup is Rails 6.0.3.4 and Ruby 2.6.5*
